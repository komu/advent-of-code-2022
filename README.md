# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This year, my focus is not on short or cute, but raw performance. Goal is to measure
individual parts in microseconds instead of milliseconds and to solve every problem with
a total budget of 100 milliseconds.

## Results

All rows with solutions over a millisecond are marked with ðŸ˜”, those with over 50 ms are marked with ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”. The days
exceeding 500 ms are marked with ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”.

In the end, days 15 and 19 blew the 100 ms budget by themselves while days 20 and 23 were over 50 ms.
Ignoring those outliers, the total time for the rest of the 21 days is 69 ms, which is pretty decent, especially
considering that only day 19 exceeded total runtime of one second and even that is under two seconds. That said,
the total runtime for all days is 1.98 seconds, which almost 20 times more than the budgeted 100 ms.
