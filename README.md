# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This year, my focus is neither on cute nor readable, but raw performance. Goal is to measure
microseconds instead of milliseconds and to solve every problem faster than a JVM starts, which
gives us about 100 ms for the total budget.
